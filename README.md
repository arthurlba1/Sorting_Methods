# Sorting Methods
![Banner](/Sorting_App.png?raw=true)

Project to visualize and compare the ordering methods

This is a project of the university, in which the intention is to show what are the methods of ordering that exist.
Observing and evaluating the complexity of each method with the help of the Runnable library of java and the Random library, generating random values for the vectors that the methods receive and evaluating the time spent by each of them.

Each sorting algorithm has what's known as "Algorithm Complexity", which is nothing more than the amount of work required to perform a task that takes place due to several factors.
This amount of work has to do with time, but it can also refer to the amount of memory needed to guarantee its execution.


In the image below you can check the time and space spent by each verified algorithm and note, that the time in nanoseconds matches the time spent.
